  <p>
    I am currently a senior undergraduate at Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University.
    Previously, I had the privilege to work as a research intern at the 
    <a href="https://usc-gvl.github.io/" target="_blank">Geometry, Vision, and Learning (GVL) Laboratory</a> 
    at the University of Southern California, under the supervision of Prof. 
    <a href="https://yuewang.xyz/" target="_blank">Yue Wang</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interests focus on Robotics and Embodied Intelligence, especially on the following topics:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scalable and General-Purpose Humanoid Robot Learning</strong>: where I believe that expanding data scale remains crucial for meaningful advances.</li>
    <li><strong>Robot Learning from Environmental and Human Interaction</strong>: with an emphasis on developing self-supervised learning approaches in real-world scenarios.</li>
    <li><strong>Reliable Robot Hardware Design</strong>: where I explore the co-optimization of hardware and software solutions to create more robust robotic systems.</li>
  </ul>
