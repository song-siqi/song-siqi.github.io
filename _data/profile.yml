    I am currently a senior undergraduate at Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University.
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously, I had the privilege to work as an undergraduate research intern under the supervision of Prof. 
    <a href="https://yuewang.xyz/" target="_blank">Yue Wang</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interests focus on Robot Learning and Embodied Intelligence, especially on the following topics:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scalable, Reliable and General-Purpose Robot Learning</strong>: Can data scaling bring robust perception and control, especially humanoids?</li>
    <li><strong>Learning from Environment and Human Interaction</strong>: Self-supervised robot learning, in both simulation and real-world scenarios.</li>
  </ul>
