    I am currently a senior undergraduate at Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University.

    Previously, I had the privilege to work as an undergraduate research intern under the supervision of Prof. 
    <a href="https://yuewang.xyz/" target="_blank">Yue Wang</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>I am currently seeking for an Ph.D./R.A. position starting from Fall 2026.</strong> Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in my research or have any questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interests focus on Embodied Intelligence and Robotics, in particular on the following aspects:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Advancing Robot-Environment-Human Interaction</strong>: With the intricate dynamics of reality, how can robots seamlessly engage in complex yet meaningful interactions with the environment and humans?</li>
    <li><strong>Learning the Embodiment and Understanding the Environment</strong>: How do robotic embodiments grasp their own physical capabilities and properties, as well as the characteristics of the surrounding environment? Furthermore, how does this knowledge shape their decision-making processes and execution strategies?</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-agent Collaboration</strong>: How can multiple embodiments work together to tackle complex problems?</li>
    <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning and Self-Supervised Learning</strong>: How do these methodologies enhance the efficiency of learning for embodiments?</li>
  </ul>
